# WellBeingPredictorML

This project utilizes various Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the 'life satisfaction' variable in the Understanding Society: UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) survey.

## Dataset

Due to its size (164MB) and legal restrictions, the dataset used (`jkl_indresp.tab`) is not uploaded. It is accessible through the UK Data Service webpage.

#### Accessing the Dataset

1. Register or log in with university or other credentials at the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/registration/registration-login-faqs/).
2. Search for 'UKHLS' in their data catalogue.
3. Locate the 9th wave of the study, and withing all the files (probably you need to download them all) use the `jkl_indresp.tab` file.
